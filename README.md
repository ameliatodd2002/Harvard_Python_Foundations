**Harvard Introduction to Computer Science with Python (CSCI S-7)**

This repository contains problem sets (Psets) and projects from Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science with Python (CSCI S-7), along with my personal notes from the course.

Course Overview:

Harvard’s CSCI S-7 is an introduction to computer science and computational thinking, with an emphasis on problem-solving, algorithm design, and programming in Python. The course covered foundational programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic techniques while introducing principles of software development and computational efficiency.

We began with fundamental computational concepts using Scratch, a block-based programming language, before transitioning to Python. Topics covered include:

**Fundamental Programming Concepts:**
- Syntax and semantics of Python
- Variables, data types, and memory allocation
- Control structures (conditionals, loops, and iteration)
- Functions, recursion, and modular programming
  
**Data Structures & Algorithmic Thinking:**
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- String manipulation and text processing
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Computational complexity and algorithm efficiency (Big O notation)
  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
- Classes, objects, and methods
- Encapsulation, abstraction, and information hiding
- Inheritance and polymorphism
  
**Computational Applications:**
- Data analysis and visualization using Python
- File handling and data processing
- Working with external libraries for scientific computing
- Introduction to graphics and simple game development
  
**Theoretical Computer Science:**
- Problem complexity and computational limits
- Introduction to unsolvable and intractable problems
- Ethical considerations in computing


**Projects in This Repository:**

- Each folder contains a problem set (Pset) featuring Python scripts that demonstrate key programming concepts from the course.
- Topics explored include algorithmic problem-solving, recursion, object-oriented design, and data structures.
- Personal class notes are included for additional context and insights.

This course built a strong foundation in computational problem-solving, software development principles, and algorithmic thinking, providing essential skills for more advanced studies in software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence.
